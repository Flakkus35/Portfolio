          Hey all! My name is Devon Wood and I have been working in web development learning
          languages such as Javascript, HTML, CSS, and SASS among others to create new and
          interesting applications. While primarily working in frontend development I also have
          experience working in backend technologies such as Express and Ruby on Rails in addition
          to major databases like MySQL, Postgres and Mongo. I am currently working for Trilogy
          Education helping new people enter into this industry.
        </p>

          I have spent most of my life surrounded by computers and have enjoyed working with a
          multitude of different software in many fields. I taught myself several 3D modeling and
          graphic design software starting from when I was 17 learning programs like Autodesk Maya,
          Adobe Photoshop, and ZBrush to name a few. I have also worked with several game engines
          including Unity and the Unreal Engine to make a few small projects.
